// #In algos.js, write a function 
// #that takes an array of words or phrases and returns the longest word or phrase in the array. So if we gave your function the array of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer phrase"], it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based on what you already know, rather than Googling the fanciest solution or looking up built-in sorting functions. Note that "some string".length will do what you expect in JS.
