// In phase-0-tracks/js, create a file called explore.js.
// Ruby has lots of handy functions like .reverse, but in JavaScript, we mostly have to write our own. In comments, pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string. reverse("hello"), for example, should return "olleh". This isn't a task specific to JavaScript -- your pseudocode should be in plain English and use phrases like "for each" instead of JavaScript-specific terms. Remember that you can add strings in JavaScript, so '' + 'a' would result in the string 'a'. Take your time. This is the most valuable skill in programming: being able to think through a problem logically.
